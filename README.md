# The-Exceeds-Log

This is a .csv file filter I created for guild management in the game [Spiral Knights](https://www.spiralknights.com "Spiral Knight's Homepage")

To see it in action, simply upload the .csv file you can get by clicking the "Save Complete Log to Desktop" button on "Guild records" in-game.
File example: [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l6BxHS6t1kriaNpU2HdKh0aUY3i0CGqW/view?usp=sharing ".csv file example")

Once uploaded, click the four buttons to receive a filtered message in the box below.

Print: Prints the entire .csv file
Membership: Prints only Membership category of the .scv file
Storage: Prints only the Storage category of the .scv file
Treasury: Prints only the Treasury category of the .scv file
